# This is the configuration file for the Ansible plugin for PuppetDB inventory.
#
# Author: David Moreau Simard <dmsimard@iweb.com>
#
# == Parameters
# - host: Host on which to connect to for PuppetDB
# - port: PuppetDB jetty port
# - timeout: Timeout for connection
# - ssl_verify: Whether or not to verify SSL certificate
# - ssl_key: Path to SSL client key
# - ssl_cert: Path to SSL client cert
# - cache_file: Where to store the inventory cache
# - cache_duration: How long should cache persist until refreshed automatically
# - group_by: Generate groups based on puppet fact values
#
# == Notes on group_by
# This will generate ansible-compatible groups based on fact values
# For example, if you want to group hosts based on the 'kernelversion' fact,
# set group_by to 'kernelversion'.
# This will generate something like this:
# "3.2": {
#   hosts: [ 'server1', 'server2' ]
# },
# "3.13": {
#   hosts: [ 'server3', 'server4' ]
# },
# "3.16": {
#   hosts: [ 'server5' ]
# }
#
# Regardless of whether or not group_by is set, the inventory will
# always return a group called 'all' with all the hosts in it.
